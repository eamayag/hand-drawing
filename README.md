# Free-hand-drawing demo:

Testing npm package: [React Sketch canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sketch-canvas).
The goal is storing info of paths (and not the full image) in database, so it can be recovered and render it again. Therefore, [Transit Immutable Js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/transit-immutable-js) npm package is added, implementing the process of converting immutable list (paths info) to JSON (get paths), recovering with conversion of JSON to immutable list object again (load paths). 

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)-based.

## Running the app

In the project directory: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), to view it in the browser.
